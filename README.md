# Employee-Salary-Data
This is my first data analytics project where I learned data cleaning, formatting, and analyzing data and finding insight from them. 
We have employee names, salaries, designations, departments, and other related information in the raw data.  

Data Analysis Report: Employee Salary Data

1. Introduction:
The purpose of this report is to present the findings of a data analysis performed on the Employee salary dataset. The dataset contains various attributes, including employees' names, designations, department names, joining dates, and years of service. The data has been cleaned and processed to extract relevant information for analysis.

2. Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Before proceeding with the analysis, the raw Employee salary data was subjected to thorough cleaning and preparation. The following steps were undertaken:

Handling missing values: Any missing or null values in the dataset were identified and handled appropriately, either by imputing them with reasonable values or removing them, depending on the nature of the missing data.


Data type conversion: The joining dates were converted into the year of joining to facilitate easier analysis based on the employees' tenure.

CTC conversion: The salary data, initially provided in a different format, was converted to lakhs for standardization and ease of interpretation.

3. Data Analysis:
After the data cleaning and preparation phase, various analyses were conducted to gain insights into the employee salary data. The following are some of the key findings:

Insights from Employee Salary Data Analysis:

Hiring Trends in 2021:
The data indicates that 2021 saw the highest number of hirings compared to other years. This spike in hiring activity could be attributed to various factors such as business expansion, increased project demands, or the organization's response to market opportunities. The significant hiring volume in 2021 might have implications on the organization's overall workforce composition and potential challenges in onboarding and training.

Salary Distribution by Designation:
The analysis reveals that the designation of Vice President (VP) commands the highest salary among all the roles in the organization. This finding is consistent across all departments, indicating that VP roles are compensated at a premium level due to their critical responsibilities and leadership positions.

On the other hand, the executive designation has the lowest salary compared to other roles in all departments. This suggests that executives may be at an entry-level or have fewer responsibilities compared to other positions. Alternatively, it could signify a deliberate salary structure to reward employees as they progress to higher-level roles within the organization.

Popular Department for Junior Manager Hires:
The analysis highlights that the Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) department hired the highest number of employees at the Junior Manager level. This observation suggests that the D2C department might be undergoing significant growth or expansion, requiring more Junior Managers to handle various operational tasks and responsibilities. Further exploration into the D2C department's expansion plans and performance could provide valuable context to this hiring trend.

D2C Dominates Employee Count:
The data shows that the Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) department has the highest number of employees compared to other departments. This could be due to the strategic importance of D2C operations for the organization or the increasing focus on direct customer engagement and sales. The larger workforce in the D2C department may present unique management challenges and opportunities for optimizing team performance and employee satisfaction.

Salary Range and Statistics:
The salary data analysis indicates that the highest salary recorded in the dataset is 75 lakhs, while the minimum salary is 2.11 lakhs. This wide salary range suggests the presence of both highly compensated roles and lower-level positions within the organization.

The total number of employees in the dataset is 106, with an average salary of 10 lakhs. This average salary figure provides a general overview of the salary levels in the organization. However, further analysis of salary distribution by department, designation, and experience level would yield more comprehensive insights into the organization's compensation structure.

Conclusion:
The insights derived from the data analysis provide valuable information about the hiring trends, salary distribution across designations and departments, and the concentration of employees in various roles. Understanding these insights can help the organization make informed decisions about talent acquisition, salary structuring, and resource allocation to ensure efficient workforce management and overall business growth. Further exploration and regular updates to such analyses can aid the organization in staying competitive in the job market and maintaining employee satisfaction and retention.
